# Flag Quest
Flag Quest is a rogue like game created to spread
awareness of LGBTQ+ identities by integrating the elements
of LGBTQ+ flags into fun puzzles. As the game’s player, you
wander through the dark woods, navigating around or overcoming
obstacles to collect the different colors of your identity.
As you collect each color, you’ll learn more about the
history of the flag and the identity that it represents.

## Software Impact
A big aspect of this project was placing an emphasis on education and proper
representation of the LGBTQ+ community.

There is no perfect way to make sure that all groups were properly represented.
Due to the scope of this project, many groups and identities within the LGBTQ+
community could not be included. We worked with members of the Olin LGBTQ+
community to determine which identities seemed most important to include.

For the groups that are represented in the game, there is still potential for
misrepresentation and mitigation of historical struggles. We worked with Olin's
Director of Diversity and Inclusion & Title IX Coordinator as well as members of
the LGBTQ+ community to make the best effort towards proper representation.
However, these communities have deep and complicated histories and it is
impossible to represent them wholly.

Generally, we tried to air on the side of caution in regards to this project.
With our main goal being to raise awareness about this group and to encourage
the players to do further research.

## Accolades
Thank you to Gilbert Baker, Monica Helms, Michael Page, and all other
creators of the various LGBTQ+ flags that we based this game
around. Thank you to Rame Hanna and members of the Olin
LGBTQ+ community for help with representing groups of the LGBTQ+
community properly.

Thank you as well to all the people of the internet
and Olin community who contributed their thoughts and examples
for our learning. Special thanks to Dieter Brehm for letting us
analyze his random world generation code for inspiration. Thanks 
to Arwen Sadler for letting us use their modified trans terminology
paper (Originally from TSER).

We used a variety of online resources during the creation of our game, see more [here](https://sd19spring.github.io/FlagQuest/resources).
