I am an Electrical and Computer Engineering major, class of 2022.

I was excited to work on this project because I am trans and I wanted to raise more awareness about the LGBT community. My main goal was to make the game spur interest in learning more about the LGBT community. I wanted to make sure the educational aspects in the game were approachable and enjoyable.

I am also an organization freak - I was jumping up and down since week one of the project about wanting to do code organization.
